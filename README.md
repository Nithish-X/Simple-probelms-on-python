# Description
This is a simple Python program that converts weight between pounds (lbs) and kilograms (kg). The program takes the weight and the unit (either pounds or kilograms) as input from the user. It then performs the conversion and displays the result in the other unit.

# How it works
The program prompts the user for their weight and the unit of measurement (either pounds or kilograms).
Based on the user's input, the program:
Converts pounds to kilograms (1 lb = 0.45 kg).
Converts kilograms to pounds (1 kg = 2.2 lbs).
It then prints out the converted value.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Instructions
Run the program.
Enter your weight when prompted.
Enter the unit of measurement as:
"L" for pounds (lbs).
"K" for kilograms (kg).
The program will print the converted weight in the opposite unit.
